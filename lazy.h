/**
 * @class LazyBinomialHeap
 *
 * @brief A mergeable heap data structure implementation using lazy binomial heap.
 *
 * @details This mergeable heap is implemented using the binomial heap data structure.
 * A binomial heap is a collection of binomial trees, where each binomial tree is a
 * heap-ordered tree. A binomial tree of order k is a tree with 2^k nodes, where each
 * node has a key and a pointer to its parent and its leftmost child. The binomial heap
 * is a collection of binomial trees of different orders, where each order is represented
 * by a linked list of binomial trees. The root list of the heap is a linked list of the
 * roots of the binomial trees in the heap, hence its size is logarithmic in the number of
 * nodes in the heap in the average case. The current implementation of the binomial heap
 * is lazy, meaning that the heap is consolidated only when needed, during the extract_min
 * operation. This allows for O(1) insertions and merges, and an amortized O(log n) extract_min.
 * Amortized analysis is used to analyze the time complexity of the consolidate operation,
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the elements stored in the heap. `T` must be movable, as it is
 * moved into the heap in the insert method.
